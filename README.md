# Library Management System in Java

A simple Java project demonstrating **object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts** including:

- Packages
- Classes and objects
- Access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`, default)
- Static variables
- Constructors (default and parameterized)
- Encapsulation with getters and setters
- Object interaction
- Using Lists (`List` interface and `ArrayList` implementation)

This project simulates a small **library system** where members can borrow books and track the total number of books in the system.
